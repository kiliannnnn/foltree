# Foltree

Foltree is a small program I made with python that aims to help me writing folders structure for the readme files of my projects instead of doing it manually or with AI. It can also do the other way job, convert structure given by AI tools into real folders.
***Large structure may take a while to parse or fail***

***This code was built and tested using Python 3.13.1***

## Usage

To start the program, either use python or build a .exe program
But first you need to install the dependencies
```python
pip install customtkinter CTkToolTip
```

### Python (recommended)
Only the file named FoltreeGUI.py is required
```python
python .\FoltreeGUI.py
```
