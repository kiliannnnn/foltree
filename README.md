# Foltree

Foltree is a small program I made with python that aims to help me writing folders structure for the readme files of my projects instead of doing it manually or with AI. It can also do the other way job, convert structure given by AI tools into real folders.
***The program is working well but no security were added, avoid giving an enormous folder to the tool.***

## Usage

To start the program, either use python or build a .exe program

### Python (recommended)
Only the file named FoltreeGUI.py and located in the root is required
```python
python .\FoltreeGUI.py
```
